# RethinkDB Cluster using Vagrant
Install [RethinkDB](http://rethinkdb.com) using [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com).

## Quick Start -- One Liner
    git clone git@github.com:zebpalmer/rethinkdb-vagrant.git && \
        cd rethinkdb-vagrant && \
        ./rethinkdb.sh


## Cluster
To start the default three node cluster run the quick start above, or if you've already cloned the repo
you can run "./rethinkdb.sh"

If you would like to add more nodes, there are 11 slaves definitions available.
By default, master, slave1 and slave2 are started, start others by running "vagrant up slaveX".

By default, you access the dashboard here:
[http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

To stop the Cluster, run "vagrant destroy"


## Status
This is a third generation fork (love open source!) of a simple RethinkDB vagrant environment originally posted last year.
The original fork was a single instance, the intermediate fork added multiple nodes but was missing some config items
that were required (added in recent RethinkDB versions?). This version, should give you a working cluster with just the
"vagrant up" command. This needs a bit more tlc but for now, it works.
